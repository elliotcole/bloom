# bloom

Bloom is a model for a musical object that can be transformed. It is a general tool that can be used in computer-aided composition, generative music, live coding, building interactive systems, and more. I developed it for my personal use, and it is the subject of my PhD disseration "Composing with Blooms."

To install, download the Bloom folder and put it in your SuperCollider User Support Directory in the Extensions folder.  If you have no Extensions folder, create one.

To read the in-IDE helpfile, type Bloom and press Command-D.

The Keystroke Controller is the easiest way to work with Blooms. To use it, open from /Tools and run.

(To run a block of code in Supercollider, click inside a parenthesed area and press command-enter.)

# bloom

Bloom is a model for a musical object that can be transformed. It is a general tool that can be used in computer-aided composition, generative music, live coding, building interactive systems, and more. I developed it for my personal use, and it is the subject of my PhD disseration "Composing with Blooms."

To install:
1) download the Bloom folder
2) if you don't have SuperCollider, download it from https://supercollider.github.io and drag to your Applications folder and open.
3) In SuperCollider: File Menu > Open User Support Directory
4) In that directory, put the entire Bloom folder into the folder 'Extensions.' If you have no Extensions folder, create one (with a capital E).

To read the helpfile, type Bloom into a SuperCollider document and press Command-D.

The Keystroke Controller is the easiest way to work with Blooms. To use it, open from /Tools and run.

(To run a block of code in Supercollider, click inside a parenthesed area and press command-enter.)
